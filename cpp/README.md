# 💣 C++ for Cybersecurity

This folder contains C++ programs and red team utilities focused on **performance-critical security tasks**, **memory-level control**, and **reverse engineering**.

> 🧠 These tools and projects are part of my long-term learning roadmap to build **Secverse** — a lean cybersecurity brand focused on offensive security, automation, and red team tooling.

---

## 📂 Example Topics

- 🐛 Simulated malware (for educational red teaming)
- 📦 Packet sniffers and socket tools
- 🔐 Encryption/decryption (XOR, Caesar, custom)
- 🕵️ ELF/PE format parsing and disassembly
- 💾 Keyloggers, reverse shells (sandbox safe)

---

## 💡 How to Use

- Programs are written for **Linux (Arch)** using `g++`
- Each program includes:
  - Clear **comments**
  - **Compile/run instructions**
- Some projects may later require root privileges or raw sockets
- Refer to the [main repo README](../README.md) for the broader roadmap

## 🧭 Study Roadmap: C++ for Cybersecurity

> Goal: Use C++ to build custom tools for red teaming, malware simulation, and low-level OS/network interaction.

---

### 🗓️ Week 1: C++ Fundamentals
- ✅ Data types, control flow, functions, arrays
- ✅ Input/output with `cin`, `cout`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`
- ✅ Compile with `g++`, manage with `Makefile`

### 🗓️ Week 2: System-Level Programming (Linux Focus)
- 📁 File handling: create, read, and modify files
- 🧵 Process control: fork, exec, signals
- 🧩 Interacting with system calls via `unistd.h`, `sys/stat.h`

### 🗓️ Week 3: Network Programming
- 🌐 Create raw TCP/UDP sockets
- 📡 Build simple reverse/bind shells
- 🧰 Explore `libpcap` for packet capture

### 🗓️ Week 4: Security Tool Development
- 🕷️ Build a custom packet sniffer
- 🔐 Implement Caesar, XOR encryption/decryption tools
- 📋 Create simple keylogger (for test VMs only)

### 🗓️ Week 5: Reverse Engineering & Static Analysis
- 📁 Learn ELF (Linux) and PE (Windows) binary formats
- 🧠 Work with Capstone disassembly engine (basic instruction parsing)
- 🔍 Analyze binary structure manually

### 🗓️ Week 6: Offensive Simulations (Advanced)
- 🔫 Simulate malware behavior (benign sandbox-only programs)
- 📬 Implement basic C2 communication (dummy data exfil)
- 🧹 Add stealth features (simple evasion methods like hiding processes or obfuscating strings)

## 🛠️ Tools, Headers & Libraries to Learn

| Tool/Library         | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| `iostream`, `fstream`       | File I/O |
| `unistd.h`, `sys/types.h`   | Linux syscalls |
| `sys/socket.h`, `netinet/in.h`, `arpa/inet.h` | Raw socket programming |
| `signal.h`, `fcntl.h`       | Process/signals |
| `libpcap`                   | Packet sniffing |
| `Capstone` disassembler     | Instruction analysis (RE) |
| `Makefile`                  | Code organization |

## 🔐 Sample Projects You’ll Build

- `xor_cipher.cpp` — Encrypt/decrypt files with XOR
- `packet_sniffer.cpp` — Capture and analyze raw packets
- `simple_backdoor.cpp` — Reverse shell simulation (on local VM)
- `keylogger.cpp` — Log keystrokes to file (educational only)
- `file_watcher.cpp` — Watch sensitive files for tampering
- `pe_elf_parser.cpp` — Show binary metadata (static analysis)
