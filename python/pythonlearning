#CODES FOR ALL UPLOADED
##BASICS
- How to write and run a Python script
- Variables and basic data types (str, int, bool, list) 
- How to print values

## My Example
```python
print("Hello world")
#VARIABLES
country = "Kenya"
goal = "Become a cybersecurity specialist"

print("Country:", country)
print("Goal:", goal)
```

##CONTROL STRUCTURES
This let the programs make conclusions

- How to use if/elif/else for decision-making
- How to use for and while loops for repetition

## Code Examples

```python
# Print even numbers from 2 to 10 using a for loop
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(i)

# Countdown from 5 to 1 using while
num = 5
while num > 0:
    print(num)
    num -= 1

# Python Test

## 1. Variables and Data Types
- Create variables for your name, age, and a list of your favorite programming languages.
- Print each variable on a separate line.

---

## 2. If/Else Logic
- Write a script that checks if a variable `score` is greater than or equal to 50. If so, print "Pass". Otherwise, print "Fail".

---

## 3. For Loops
- Write a for loop that prints all numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

---

## 4. While Loops
- Write a while loop that prints numbers from 10 down to 6 (inclusive).

---

## 5. Combining Concepts
- Given a list of ages: `[12, 17, 19, 24, 15, 30]`, use a for loop and if/else to print `"Adult"` if the age is 18 or older, otherwise print `"Minor"`.

---

## 6. Code Reading
What will this code print?

```python
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("Big")
else:
    print("Small")
print("Done")
```

#ABOUT TO GET ALITTLE HARDER WITH FUNCTONS BUT TAKE YOUR TIME AND TRY OUT QUESTIONS THAT I PUT OUT
Python Functions and Modules

## What I Learned
- How to define and use functions
- Using default arguments
- Organizing code into modules and importing them

## My Code Examples
  I HAVE UPLOADED ON THIS REPO
(Include your exercise solutions and any experiments)

                                                                                     # Python Functions & Control Structures Test

---

## 1. Functions (Basic)
Write a function called `multiply` that takes two numbers and returns their product. Call it with 4 and 5, and print the result.

---

## 2. Default Arguments
Write a function called `greet` with a default argument `name="Friend"`. It should print "Hello, [name]!".  
Call it with no arguments, and then with your name.

---

## 3. For Loop with Functions
Write a function called `square_all` that takes a list of numbers and prints the square of each number using a for loop.  
Test it with `[2, 4, 6]`.

---

## 4. While Loop & If-Else
Write a while loop that starts at 7 and counts down to 1.  
If the number is even, print "[number] is even". If odd, print "[number] is odd".

---

## 5. Modules
Create a file `math_utils.py` with a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum.  
From a separate script, import `math_utils` and print the sum of 3 and 6.

---

## 6. Code Reading
What will this code print?
```python
def check(x):
    if x < 0:
        return "Negative"
    elif x == 0:
        return "Zero"
    else:
        return "Positive"

print(check(-2))
print(check(0))
print(check(10))
```
