# 🐍 Python for Cybersecurity

This folder contains Python scripts and projects built to automate, analyze, and solve real-world cybersecurity and digital forensics challenges.

> 🔧 Developed as part of my solo cybersecurity journey under **Secverse**, focused on offensive security, automation, and AI-driven protection.

---

## 📂 Example Topics

- 🔍 Port scanning (TCP/UDP)
- 🔐 Password cracking & dictionary attacks
- 📊 Log file parsing and analysis
- 🌐 Network automation with Nmap or custom scripts
- ☁️ Threat intelligence integrations via APIs
- 🔥 Auto-blocking suspicious activity using firewalls

---

## 💡 How to Use

- Each script includes:
  - Clear **comments** and usage examples
  - Input/output samples (where applicable)
- Some tools may require external libraries (check README or `requirements.txt`)
- Refer to the [main repo README](../README.md) for the full learning plan

## 🧭 Study Roadmap: Python for Cybersecurity

> Goal: Learn Python through **practical**, **security-focused** projects.

---

### 🗓️ Week 1: Python Fundamentals for Security
- ✅ Variables, input/output, conditionals, loops, functions
- ✅ File handling: `open()`, `read()`, `write()`
- ✅ Exception handling for tool stability

### 🗓️ Week 2: Working with Core Libraries
- 📁 `os`, `sys` — filesystem and system calls
- ⚙️ `subprocess` — execute system tools (e.g., `nmap`)
- 🌐 `socket` — build network scanners
- 📋 `argparse` — add CLI support to tools

### 🗓️ Week 3: Network Reconnaissance Tools
- 📡 Build TCP/UDP port scanners
- 🖥️ Host discovery via ICMP (`ping`)

### 🗓️ Week 4: Password Cracking Basics
- 🔐 Brute-force a ZIP file using `zipfile`, `itertools`
- 🧠 Dictionary attack against password hashes

### 🗓️ Week 5: Log Analysis
- 📈 Parse Apache/Nginx logs for:
  - IPs
  - User agents
  - Response codes
- 🧹 Extract patterns using `re`, `pandas`, or simple string methods

### 🗓️ Week 6: Network Automation
- 🚀 Automate Nmap scans with `subprocess` or `python-nmap`
- 📲 Send notifications via email or Discord webhook

### 🗓️ Week 7: Real-World Security Projects
- 🧠 Threat Intel Tool:
  - Use APIs like AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, Shodan
- 🛡️ Auto-block malicious IPs using:
  - `iptables`, `firewall-cmd`, or `ufw`
