# Study Roadmap: Python for Cybersecurity

This roadmap is helping me learn Python through practical cybersecurity projects.

## ‚úÖ Week 1: Python Fundamentals for Security
- Input/output, conditionals, loops,functions 
- File handling (open/read/write)
- Exception handling

## ‚úÖ Week 2: Working with Libraries
- `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `socket`
- `argparse` for command-line tools

## ‚úÖ Week 3: Networking Tools
- Build a simple port scanner (TCP/UDP)
- Host availability check with `ping`

## ‚úÖ Week 4: Password Cracking Basics
- Brute force ZIP file cracker using `zipfile`
- Dictionary attack (with a wordlist)

## ‚úÖ Week 5: Log Analysis
- Parse Apache access logs
- Extract IPs, user agents, request stats

## ‚úÖ Week 6: Network Automation
- Automate Nmap scans (`subprocess`, `nmap` lib)
- Send alerts (email or Discord webhook)

## ‚úÖ Week 7: Real-World Projects
- Threat intel tool (check IPs/domains with APIs)
- Auto-block suspicious IPs via `iptables` or `firewall-cmd`
