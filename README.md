# Cybersecurity Learning Repository

Welcome! This repository helps you inlearning **Python**, **C++**, and **Shell scripting** for cyber security and forensics.

## Structure

- [`python/`](python/) — Python scripts for security, automation, and analysis
- [`cpp/`](cpp/) — C++ tools for performance-critical security tasks
- [`shell/`](shell/) — Bash scripts for automation, system and forensics tasks

## Study Roadmap

1. **Python**
   - Syntax basics, scripting, automation
   - Security tools (port scanners, log analyzers)
2. **C++**
   - Language fundamentals, memory management
   - Writing security utilities, exploit stubs
3. **Shell**
   - Bash scripting, file operations
   - Forensics and system automation

## How I Use This Repo

- Each language has its own folder.
- I document each project and script with comments and README files.
- I update notes and references as I learn new concepts.
